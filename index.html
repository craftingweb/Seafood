                  and a shooting hand. But you have to act quickly: after a
                  second or two, the crab realizes what's happening and uses its
                  claws to pinch you as hard as it can, and it won't let you go
                  easily. Thus, catching crabs not only provides a delicious
                  meal, but also produces an adrenaline rush.

                  The Gulf Stream, carrying warm water from the Gulf of Mexico
                  across the Atlantic Ocean, flows north along the Norwegian
                  coast into the clear, clear, icy water of the Arctic. This
                  creates ideal conditions for an incredibly rich marine

                  Small fish, large fish, shellfish and other life forms. Some

                  globe. Some prefer the cold open sea, others live in quiet,
                  deep fjords protected by walls of islands and skerries. Each

                  is one of the main reasons why Norway is the second largest
                  exporter of seafood in the world. And there's also a reason

                  international importance of this industry is clearly

                  approximately 150 countries. We are the second largest

                  it supports has been the basis of our existence since the
                  Stone Age. We know that we have a responsibility to pass this
                  on to future generations. The sea is the gift that keeps on
                  giving, but only as long as we continue to respect it and take
                  care of what we have been given.

                  systems of sustainable development and management in both
                  fisheries and aquaculture. This is not an accident, but
                  systematic work at all levels to ensure the safety of
                  consumers and the well-being of fish. A strong focus on animal
                  welfare and strict regulations mean that our seafood is
                  consistently high quality and safe to eat. Production is
                  environmentally friendly and responsible, leaving a minimal
                  footprint on the environment.
